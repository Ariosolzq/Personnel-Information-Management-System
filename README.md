# Personnel-Information-Management-System
## Project Description
This information management system is designed to differentiate and manage data for healthcare workers and patients within Guilin City under the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic. Developed in C language, it aims to streamline processes for grassroots organizations such as community centers and hospitals, focusing on the efficient handling and interaction of critical data.

## Features
- **User Segregation**: Separate login modules for healthcare professionals and patients.
- **Data Management**: Personal information, health records, and travel history database.
- **Health Monitoring**: Real-time updates of nucleic acid test results.
- **Data Analysis**: Tools for analyzing patient data and healthcare statistics.
- **Security**: Encryption and secure data handling protocols.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- A C compiler such as GCC (for compiling from source)
- Windows OS (if using the provided `.exe`)

### Compiling from Source
1. Install a C compiler if you don't have one. [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) is recommended.
2. Clone the repository or download the source code.
3. Navigate to the code directory.
4. Compile the source code.
5. Run the compiled program.

### Using the Executable
1. Download the `.exe` file from the repository.
2. Run the executable file by double-clicking on it in Windows Explorer, or from the command line:

## Usage
This system has two user interfaces: one for healthcare workers and another for returning residents. Healthcare workers can manage their own and residents' data, whereas returning residents can only manage their personal information. The system includes features like adding, browsing, and modifying personnel data, and updating nucleic acid test results.

## Documentation
The document describes the system's background, requirements, and functionalities. It covers the logic structure and storage design, detailing the use of arrays for sequential storage and the struct data type for organizing information about medical staff and returning residents.

## Contributing
For those interested in contributing, the system is built in C language and could be enhanced for better performance or additional features. Potential areas for development include improving the interface and integrating database management for more efficient data handling.

## Credits
Special thanks to my mother, a medical worker, whose experiences inspired this project. Her insights were crucial in shaping the system's functionalities to meet the practical needs of grassroots healthcare organizations.
